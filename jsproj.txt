Im 29, i studied before but didnt continue because my sisters, i sacrifice myself to work so they can study because our parents that time coulnt afford. So i worked for couple of years. years later my sister got a business, it was booming. Sometimes I would ask money from her, 2-3 years if i got short up to this day. Now my two sisters are partner in business and my family want me to go back to college, so I went back, after seven years, here I am again. on my first year in college they still gave me money if i ask, but right now im 2nd year, (i dont ask money from my mom for my daily needs, she gave me just enough for the day), i feel like everytime i chat them or went to see them or went to the shop, i feel like they think that I would ask for money everytime, i think maybe thats why they dont reply often or they snob me like that, so what i do sometimes i go to the shop or see them in just a few minutes and leave immediately. Now, i feel like a real burden and i think the best way to do is not to let them feel my presence or chat them even if i look like a bad brother because i will look like i ignore them or dont want to be around them, i wont tell them my reason, ill find an excuse to not go to my sisters birthday party or other occations and as much as possible speak less to them and not ask about money. Act like a person or a friend, what would you advise or say
